                       <p>Hi Everyone,
                        I am Amandeep Kaur and Currently student in Lambton college, Toronto. 
                      </p>
                    
                      <h3>A little about childhood</h3>
                      <p> I born in small village of Haryana, India and here i spent my whole childhood. In my childhood i had 3 friends with whom i always want to play with. 
                          My friends are: Meenakshi, Reena and Manpreet. we Studied in same class from 1st grade to fifth and from 6th grade i migrated in new school which is nearby to my village.
                          I enjoy outdoor activities as a child. I surrounded myself with most funny and kind person and that person is my Papa and he is very close to my heart.
                          My father used to carry me on his shoulder and we went on evening walks nearby pond.
                          My Mother wants me to incline me most in studies and i like to play with sand as a child. and mom used to taught me counting, Alphabets etc on ground. Like she used to carry a little pen of wood stick and draw numbers and alphabets in sand which is very overwhelming to me now.
                        </p>

                <h3>As a Teenager</h3>
                <p>When i was tween i was involved in games, dance and other activities, but in my teen i become little introvert. I think this happened because of change of school and remain aprted from friends.
                    Making new friends was a task to me. I studied in my new school till 10th grade. </p>
